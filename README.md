#📄 Task 1 – Chatbot (Python)
Project Title: Rule-Based Chatbot using Python
Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a simple rule-based chatbot using Python. The chatbot interacts with users by responding to predefined queries and simulates basic human-like conversation.

Project Description

This chatbot is developed using Python logic and conditional statements. It takes user input, processes it using predefined rules, and provides appropriate responses. The chatbot can answer basic questions such as greetings, date, time, help commands, and simple queries.
Technologies Used
Python

Tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)

Datetime module

Key Features

User-friendly interaction

Rule-based responses

Handles greetings and basic queries

Displays current date and time

Simple and lightweight design

Learning Outcome

Improved Python programming skills

Understanding of conditional logic

Experience in handling user input and responses

🎬 Task 2 – Movie Recommendation System (Python)
Project Title: Movie Recommendation System using Python
Objective

The objective of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences or similarity measures.

Project Description

The movie recommendation system is implemented using Python and basic data processing techniques. The system analyzes user input or predefined data and recommends movies accordingly. It demonstrates the core concept of recommendation systems in a simplified form.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas (optional)

NumPy (optional)

Key Features

Movie recommendation based on user input

Simple logic for similarity or category-based suggestions

Easy-to-use interface

Efficient and fast execution

Learning Outcome

Understanding recommendation system concepts

Data handling using Python

Logical thinking and problem-solving skills

❌⭕ Task 3 – Tic Tac Toe Game (Python)
Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game with AI using Python
Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Tic Tac Toe game in Python where a human player competes against an AI opponent.

Project Description

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using Python with an intelligent AI player. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, making the game challenging and unbeatable. A graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented for better user experience.

Technologies Used

Python

Tkinter

Math module

Key Features

Human vs AI gameplay

Intelligent AI using Minimax algorithm

Interactive GUI

Game restart option

Winner detection and draw handling

Learning Outcome

Understanding game logic implementation

Knowledge of Minimax algorithm

GUI development using Tkinter

Enhanced problem-solving skills

✅ Conclusion

During the CODSOFT internship, I successfully completed three Python-based projects: a Chatbot, a Movie Recommendation System, and a Tic Tac Toe game. These projects helped me strengthen my Python programming skills, improve logical thinking, and gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications.
